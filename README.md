kimtorberntsson.com
======

This is the old version of kimtorberntsson without a blog built with html and css. The new page that is hosted by Github Pages and built using Jekyll can be found at the kimtorberntsson.github.io [repository](https://github.com/KimTorberntsson/kimtorberntsson.github.io).

kimtorberntsson.com was a light-weight personal homepage where my resume and some of my photographs are available. The web site also contains information about where I could be found on the internet, such as for example my mail adress and my facebook account.
