			<h1>Kim's Resume</h1>
			<h2>Previous Work</h2>
			<h3>2014 Summer Worker at Ericsson in Linköping</h3>
			<p>The second year as a summer worker at Ericsson my assignment was to write a plugin for the continous integration tool Jenkins, which is used for the integration of the code base. The prototype was primarely written in Java and was appriciated. It was evaluated by other teams at Ericsson, where it was used as an example of how a specific problem could be solved. Other teams continued with the development for a better solution and took our proposal in account as they continued their work. The source code of the prototype is available on my github page and was called <q>Build Flow Stats</q>.
			<h3>2013 Summer worker at Ericsson in Linköping</h3>
			<p>I worked with software development at the department for Product Development Support. We collected build information and presented it to help the developers. We also cleaned up a bit in some really old files. The presentation part was written in Python mostly, but we also used Bash to invoke the data collection in the build scripts. It was great to be able to work with assignments that I’m genuinely interested in and might work with later in my career.</p>
			<h3>2012 Summer worker at Rimaster in Rimforsa</h3>
			<p>I worked as an electronics assembler at the unit for cabling as a summer worker for 5 weeks. I had previously worked there as a consultant from Flextronics and it was fun to come back there and meet everyone again.</p>
			<h3>2010 - 2011 Temporary employee at Flextronics in Linköping</h3>
			<p>I enjoyed staying at Flextronics for a longer period, since I really got to know the company culture and my working colleagues. I worked primarily as an electronics assembler and build different phone prototypes and digital boxes. A week or two I also worked with logistics. It was a bit sad to leave the company since I enjoyed being there so much, but after one year off I was very excited to return to the studies again.</p>
			<h3>2010 Consultant at Adecco in Linköping</h3>
			<p>After I graduated I worked as a consultant for Adecco at different local companies in Linköping during a few months before I got an employment at Flextronics. I worked with sausage production, packaging of charcuterie products, handling of work material and with electronics assembly. It was exciting to get the opportunity to work at so many different companies and to quickly have to learn all of the working tasks.</p>
			<h3>2008, 2009 Summer worker at Flextronics in Linköping</h3>
			<p>I helped the company when they moved to a different locale by carrying office furniture and office materials. I also worked with dismantling of fixtures, packaging of circuit boards and loading of surface mount assembly machines.</p>
			<h2>Education</h2>
			<p>I’m currently studying towards becoming an engineer in Applied Physics (Teknisk Fysik) at Uppsala University. I have been studying there since 2011 and expect to have my Master's degree in 2016. After the summer in 2014, after three years of study in Uppsala, I collected my Degree of Bachelor of Science, which is now my highest level educational diploma.</p>
			<p>I studied at the natural sciences program at Katedral high school in Linköping between 2007 and 2010.</p>
			<h2>Additional Info</h2>
			<p>I have a drivers license for personal cars (and actually even for forklifts, though even I wouldn't hire me for that kind of job since I have barely touched a forklift).
			<p>I have good knowledge in both written and spoken English, like most of my peers. I guess it's natural since we are so often exposed to it.</p>
			<p>I also have a big interest in computers, programming and simulation with at least basic knowledge in all three. I sometimes get really into a physics simulation or a programming problem and then time just flies because I find it so stimulating.</p>
